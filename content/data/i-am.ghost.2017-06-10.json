So having tried blogger and Wordpress for blogging for some time now, I was on the lookout for a blogging platform that was cleaner and more customizable. That is when I came across the free blogging platform called Ghost.\nNow the platform itself is free but you need to host the blog somewhere. Ghost themselves offer hosting options and their's is the simplest to set up, but the service doesn't come for free. This is where github comes in. There are many other free/paid hosting options out there, but I prefer to use github just because the entire hosting process is much simpler and free.\nSo let's get started! For simplicity, I have decided to split this post into two parts :\n\n* The first part will deal with the installation of Ghost on a local machine and setting it up.\n\n* The second part will explain the procedure of hosting the blog on github pages.\n\nOh by the way, I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as my OS here in this tutorial.\nBefore we install Ghost we need to take care of the dependencies.\n### Installing Dependencies\nWe need to install node.js and npm for ghost to work. So here's how we do it :\n``` \nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n```\nDownload and install the latest version of Ghost now.\n```\nwget \"https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-0.4.2.zip\"  \nunzip ghost-0.9.0.zip -d ghost  \ncd ghost  \ncp config.example.js config.js  \nnpm install  \n```\nNow, during the installation I did run into a few hiccups. Firstly, if you get error messages like `permission denied` or the likes while running any of the above commands, try attaching `sudo` in the beginning of the commands.\nNext, if you get an error like this :\n```\nFailed at the typechecker@2.0.8 preinstall script 'node ./cyclic.js'.\nnpm ERR!

Or if that isn't available, you can get their info via:\nnpm ERR!     npm owner ls typechecker\nnpm ERR! There is likely additional logging output above.\n```\nType in the following command before you type `npm install`:\n```\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n```\nand the installation should proceed smoothly after this.\n\nOnce you have Ghost installed, `cd` into the directory where you had extracted the ghost files.

Assuming that you already have git set up on your machine, we will skip that part here. You can learn how to do that [here](http://www.debdeepdey.me/blog/how-to-install-git-and-use-github-on-ubuntu-linux/).\n\nGo to Github.com and create a new repository. Name it something like yourname.github.io. This will be your Github static website URL.\n\nCreate another repository.You could call it 'blog'. After that, create a new branch called gh-pages. This branch will host your static webpage.\nClone this repository on your local machine and use `git checkout -b gh-pages` to switch to the <b>gh-pages</b> branch.\n###Configuring Buster\nBuster is a Brute force static site generator for Ghost. Github pages only supports static webpages. \nSo we need to create static webpages for Github Pages to host. There will be no admin back end for this. You will have to write your posts at 127.0.0.1:2368/ghost. This is basically just a hack but it works fine.\n\nInstall pip. pip is a python package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.\n```\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential  \npip install --upgrade pip  \nsudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv  \n```\nInstall Buster via pip\n```\npip install buster  \n```\n###Use Buster to Generate Static Webpages\nStart your Ghost blog on 127.0.0.1:2368 by \n`npm start`. While it is still running,`cd` into the repository that you had cloned earlier.\n\nSetup Buster.\n\n`buster setup  `\nWhen prompted, enter the address of the GitHub repository URL you just created.\n\nStart generating static site.\n\nbuster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368  \nThis will generate a static site based on already running Ghost on 127.0.0.1 under a newly created directory called static. Switch into the subfolder by `cd static` and copy all of it's contents into your repository folder.Then do the following to push static site to your Github repository.\n\nInside <b>blog</b> dir,\n```\ngit add -A  \ngit commit -m 'commit message'  \ngit push origin gh-pages \n```\nAlternatively, you can just skip the git command and use `buster deploy` in the <b>blog</b> directory and buster will upload it.\n\n###Adding a Custom Domain\n1.Buy a domain (eg. http://sample_domain.com)\n2.In `A Records`, point `sample_domain.com` to `192.30.252.153` or `192.30.252.154`\n3.Add a `CNAME Records` pointing any required subdomain such as `www.sample_domain.com` or `blog.sample_domain.com` to your `*.github.io` repository.\n4.Push a `CNAME` file in your repository using the following command: `buster add-domain <domain here>`. This will create a file called `CNAME` in `static/` folder. \nMake sure domain doesn't have `http://` when adding it\n5.`buster deploy`\n\n###Blogging Workflow\n1.`npm start`\n2.write posts on `localhost:2368/ghost`\n3.switch to static dir <b>blog</b>\\\n4.while running buster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368 (creates static site in /static)\n5.buster deploy on <b>blog</b>/\nOr in <b>blog/</b>,\n```\n    git add --all\n    git commit -m \"message\"\n    git push -u origin\n```\nAlternatively, you could write a simple bash script that would automate the entire process of generating static pages and deploying to github.\n\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If you haven't read the first part of this two part post,where I discuss about installing Ghost on your local machine, you can find it here : <a href=\"http://www.debdeepdey.me/blog/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-and-hosting-it-on-github-part-1-installing-ghost-locally/\">Part 1</a></p>\n\n<p>Now let's host the blog on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a>.

The COW takes a completely different approach to writing and modifying data on storage devices. It uses \"Snapshots\", which are basically clones or writable images of the current data on the FS. \nSnapshots are initially logical copies of the original data. They contain the metadata that describes the location of the original data. This makes the creation of snapshots almost instantaneous.

Apart from the Windows system partition, I have two more ntfs partitions. These partitions need to mounted explicitly when I boot into Linux. This can be automated by using the `fstab` file. In this post, I'll briefly describe the procedure to do exactly that.\nSo, what is `fstab` ?\n`/etc/fstab` is a file that contains the information that is required to mount partitions automatically during the boot process. \n`fstab` entries have a well defined syntax which is : \n```\n<device> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <fsck>\n\n```\n\n`<device>` describes the block special device or remote \nfilesystem to be mounted.\n`<dir>` describes the \nmount directory\n`<type>` the file \nsystem type.\n`<options>` the associated \nmount options.\n`<dump>` is checked by \nthe `dump` utility.\n`<fsck>` sets the order for filesystem checks at boot time\n\nAccordingly, the first thing that we need to do is to figure out the unique universal identifiers (UUIDs) of the partitions that need to be automatically mounted.\nThe `sudo blkid` command gives us not only the UUID of the partitions but also their type. Once we have these values we can edit the `/etc/fstab` file.\n\nFor example, I have an ntfs partition called \"DATA-2\" which I would like to auto-mount.

This command gives a detailed output  like so : \n```\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   350M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0  99.7G  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0 107.4G  0 part \n├─sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part \n├─sda5   8:5    0 177.8G  0 part /home/debdeep/DATA-2\n├─sda6   8:6    0  12.2G  0 part \n├─sda7   8:7    0   7.5G  0 part [SWAP]\n└─sda8   8:8    0  60.9G  0 part /\n```\nFrom this you can easily identify your drive from its storage size.\n\nNow that I have the UUID and type of the partitions, all I need to do is edit the `fstab` file to include the following entry:\n```\nUUID=\"703D24G63C14C943\"  /home/debdeep/DATA-2 ntfs-3g  defaults,noatime 0 2\n```\nOn some distributions you might need to install the `ntfs-3g` package to be able to write to ntfs partitions.
