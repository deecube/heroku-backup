So having tried blogger and Wordpress for blogging for some time now, I was on the lookout for a blogging platform that was cleaner and more customizable. That is when I came across the free blogging platform called Ghost.\nNow the platform itself is free but you need to host the blog somewhere. Ghost themselves offer hosting options and there's is the simplest to set up, but the service doesn't come for free. This is where github comes in. There are many other free/paid hosting options out there, but I prefer to use github just because the entire hosting process is much simpler. \nSo let's get started! For simplicity, I have decided to split this post into two parts :\n\n* The first part will deal with the installation of Ghost on a local machine and setting it up.\n\n* The second part will explain the procedure of hosting the blog on github pages.\n\nOh by the way, I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as my OS here in this tutorial.\nBefore we install Ghost we need to take care of the dependencies.\n### Installing Dependencies\nWe need to install nodejs and npm for ghost to work. So here's how we do it :\n``` \nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n```\nLet's download and install the latest version of Ghost now.\n```\nwget \"https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-0.4.2.zip\"  \nunzip ghost-0.9.0.zip -d ghost  \ncd ghost  \ncp config.example.js config.js  \nnpm install  \n```\nNow, during the installation I did run into a few hiccups. Firstly, if you get error messages like `permission denied` or the likes while running any of the above commands, try attaching `sudo` in the beginning of the commands.\nNext, if you get an error like this :\n```\nFailed at the typechecker@2.0.8 preinstall script 'node ./cyclic.js'.\nnpm ERR! Make sure you have the latest version of node.js and npm installed.\nnpm ERR! If you do, this is most likely a problem with the typechecker package,\nnpm ERR! not with npm itself.\nnpm ERR!

You can get information on how to open an issue for this project with:\nnpm ERR!     npm bugs typechecker\nnpm ERR! Or if that isn't available, you can get their info via:\nnpm ERR!     npm owner ls typechecker\nnpm ERR! There is likely additional logging output above.\n```\nType in the following command before you type `npm install`:\n```\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n```\nand the installation should proceed smoothly after this.\n\nOnce you have Ghost installed, start Ghost at 127.0.0.1:2368 by typing in \n```\nnpm start\n```\nNavigate to 127.0.0.1:2368/ghost for your Ghost Admin panel.\n\nCreate a new post if you'd like to.\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Okay!

Assuming that you already have git set up on your machine, we will skip that part here. You can learn how to do that [here](http://www.debdeepdey.me/blog/how-to-install-git-and-use-github-on-ubuntu-linux/).\n\nGo to Github.com and create a new repository. Name it something like yourname.github.io. This will be your Github static website URL.\n\nCreate another repository.You could call it 'blog'. After that, create a new branch called gh-pages. This branch will host your static webpage.\nClone this repository on your local machine and use `git checkout -b gh-pages` to switch to the <b>gh-pages</b> branch.\n###Configuring Buster\nBuster is a Brute force static site generator for Ghost. Github pages only supports static webpages. \nSo we need to create static webpages for Github Pages to host. There will be no admin back end for this. You will have to write your posts at 127.0.0.1:2368/ghost. This is basically just a hack but it works fine.\n\nInstall pip. A python package management.\n```\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential  \npip install --upgrade pip  \nsudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv  \n```\nInstall Buster via pip\n```\npip install buster  \n```\n###Use Buster to Generate Static Webpages\nStart your Ghost blog on 127.0.0.1:2368 by \n`npm start`. While it is still running,`cd` into the repository that you had cloned earlier.\n\nSetup Buster.\n\n`buster setup  `\nWhen prompted, enter the address of the GitHub repository URL you just created.\n\nStart generating static site.\n\nbuster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368  \nThis will generate a static site based on already running Ghost on 127.0.0.1 under a newly created directory called static. Switch into the subfolder by `cd static` and copy all of it's contents into your repository folder.Then do the following to push static site to your Github repository.\n\nInside <b>blog</b> dir,\n```\ngit add -A  \ngit commit -m 'commit message'  \ngit push origin gh-pages \n```\nAlternatively, you can just skip the git command and use `buster deploy` in the <b>blog</b> directory and buster will upload it.\n\n###Adding a Custom Domain\n1.Buy a domain (eg. http://domain.com)\n2.In `A Records`, point `domain.com` to `192.30.252.153` or `192.30.252.154`\n3.Add a `CNAME Records` pointing subdomain such as `www.domain.com` or `blog.domain.com` to your `*.github.io` repository.\n4.Push a `CNAME` file in your repository using the following command: `buster add-domain <domain here>`. This will create a file called `CNAME` in `static/` folder. \nMake sure domain doesn't have `http://` when adding it\n5.`buster deploy`\n\n###Blogging Workflow\n1.`npm start`\n2.write posts on `localhost:2368/ghost`\n3.switch to static dir <b>blog</b>\\\n4.while running buster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368 (creates static site in /static)\n5.buster deploy on <b>blog</b>/\nOr in <b>blog/</b>,\n```\n    git add --all\n    git commit -m \"message\"\n    git push -u origin\n```\nAlternatively, you could write a simple bash script that would automate the entire process of generating static pages and deploying to github.\n\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If you haven't read the first part of this two part post,where I discuss about installing Ghost on your local machine, you can find it here : <a href=\"http://www.debdeepdey.me/blog/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-and-hosting-it-on-github-part-1-installing-ghost-locally/\">Part 1</a></p>\n\n<p>Now let's host the blog on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a>.

Once you've gone through this tutorial, you will be able to use git to clone repositories, push stuff to your repositories on github.\nSo let's get started! \n###Install git\nFire up your terminal and type in the following :\n`sudo apt install git`\nNow you'll need t configure git. You can do so by the following commands\n```\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n```\n###Using git\nSo now that git has been installed, you may want to create a git repo. \n\nCreate any folder and `cd` into it from the terminal. Type in `git init`.\nNow if you want to clone a repository on Github, you can do so either by using https or ssh.\n\nFor ssh you can refer to this post [here](http://www.debdeepdey.me/blog/generate_ssh_keys_on_linux/)\nFor https, go to github.com and open the repository that you want to clone. Click on the 'Clone or Download' button and copy the `https://..` link.\n\nOn your local machine, `cd` to the directory where you want to clone the repo. \nType `git clone ` followed by the `https://` link that you have copied from github.\n\nYou can add new files by using `git add -A`. This will add all new files at once.\nFor creating a new commit after adding files, use the `git commit -m \"Message describing recent commit here\"` command.\n\nYou can use the `git push origin <insert branch name>` to push stuff to the required branch.\n\nIf you want to find out the branches that exist in a particular repo, use `git branch`.\n\nUsing the `git checkout <branch name>` command, you can switch to your desired branch.\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>In this short tutorial I am going to tell you how to install git on Linux.
